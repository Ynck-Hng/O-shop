# O-shop

Welcome to this E-Shop portfolio project !

The point of this project was practice implementing common e-shop features such as :

- setting up the main page
- open an article page 
- sorting by categories
- a fully functional cart (excluding purchasing step)
- dynamic rendering (From Back-end to Front-end)
- responsive css (using CSS and SCSS)

This project was made using NodeJS, Express, PostgresSQL and Sequelize on the Back-end side, EJS (for templating), HTML5, CSS, and SCSS for the Front-end.
